How to use xgettext with Perl.
==============================

1. Requirements to source code:

   strings that you plane to extract should be in double quotes ("");

   these strings should be marked by gettext(), gettext_noop() or any
   other keyword that you add to xgettext invocation (see --keyword
   option of xgettext);

   these strings should not have any escape sequence that represent
   backslash (`\') symbol itself (not as "\\" nor "\x5c" nor in any
   other way).  If you want output it -- use constructs like following
   instead:

        $str = sprintf(gettext("string %s continue"), "\\");

   Sorry for inconvenience, but it meets seldom, and the prize from
   using of xgettext, msgmerge and friends should be greater.

2. Just call xgettext.  It make big amount of warnings but work.

3. After this scan resulting .po file and replace any accurences of `\\'
   (doubled backslash) by `\' (single backslash).

   After this we have some uniform data that can be processed for
   building hash with translation or what you want.

   This can be done by po2pm.

4. Build from msgstr/msgid pairs a hash with translations, required by
   faqomatic.

   This can be done by po2pm.
